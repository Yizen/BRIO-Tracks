/**
 * As Graph Theory allows mathematicians and computer scientists to study
 * mathematical structures used to model relations between certain collections
 * it only makes sense to have something to play with using Node.js as well.
 *
 * You can try to build a simple graph by doing the following:
 *
 * <code>
 * var graph  = require('./lib/graph');
 * var vertex = require('./lib/vertex');
 * var edge   = require('./lib/edge');
 * var sys    = require('sys');
 *
 * var graph = new graph.Graph();
 * var VertexOne = new vertex.Vertex('label1', {});
 * var VertexTwo = new vertex.Vertex('label2', {});
 * 
 * graph.addVertex(VertexOne);
 * graph.addVertex(VertexTwo);
 * 
 * // or inline...
 * graph.addVertex(new vertex.Vertex('label3', {}));
 *
 * var EdgeExample = new edge.Edge('label1', 'label3', {});
 * 
 * graph.addEdge(EdgeExample);
 * sys.puts(sys.inspect(graph.edges()));
 *
 * </code>
 *
 * Granted this code currently does not do much apart from building the Graphs but
 * the point is to add digraphs in the short future, and then have the ability to 
 * build your graphs but then apply different types of sorting algorithms and build
 * different types of graphs and traversal, sorting, etc.
