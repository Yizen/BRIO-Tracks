/**
 * The adjacency matrix module is used to build... an adjacency matrix
 * of the graph. Using an adjancy matrix, it makes it fairly simple to 
 * identify paths in a graph.
 *
 * <code>
 * var graph = require('./lib/graph');
 * var adjacency = require('./lib/matrices/adjacency');
 * // Create a graph and add vertices....
 * var matrix = new adjacency.Adjacency(
 *    new graph.Graph().addVertex(
 *        new vertex.Vertex('name')).addVertex(
 *        new vertex.Vertex('name2')).addVertex(
 *        new vertex.Vertex('name3')).addEdge(
 *        new edge.Edge('name', 'name3'))
 * );
 * </code>
 *
 * The previous code will create an adjacency list that 
 * looks very similar to:
 *
 *          name  name2  name3
 *   name   [0]    [0]    [1]
 *   name2  [0]    [0]    [0]
 *   name3  [1]    [0]    [0]
